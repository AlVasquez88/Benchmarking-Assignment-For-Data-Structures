# Assignment 2: Benchmarking Sort & Search Algorithms
## Alvin Vasquez, 2025/09/21
This repo is my attempt of understanding and benchmarking various sorting and search algorithms in Java programming provided to me by Mohawk College.
This repo contains the following:
+ Quick Sort algorithm
+ Merge Sort algorithm
+ Radix Sort algorithm
+ Insertion Sort algorithm
+ Selection Sort algorithm
+ Bubble Sort algorithm
+ Recursive Binary Search algorithm
+ Linear Search algorithm
+ Time & space complexity for all algorithms
+ Benchmark time in milliseconds
#### Algorithms are created by Professor Mark Yendt CSAIT at Mohawk College.
